BoardPage is large. The split between BoardPage and Board is not well-defined. Bugs occur when the BoardPage gets
re-rendered.

First idea: Introduce a BoardController that is used by the BoardPage but lives on when the BoardPage gets rendered.

BUT: What is the difference between the BoardController and the Board then?

Second idea: Merge the two, then re-split along different lines, e.g. an InputInterpreter that understands mouse
clicks and keyboard codes. Maybe even extract that first if it simplifies the merge.
->
    The InputInterpreter would probably contain most of the code that would otherwise go into the BoardController,
    but now there is no obligation that the Board is agnostic to the transform, screen coordinates, HTML canvas
    etc. (which it isn't anyway).
    ...
    renamed "InputInterpreter" to "BoardEventHandler", that's more obvious.
