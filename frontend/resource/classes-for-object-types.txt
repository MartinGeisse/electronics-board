To make this work, we have to disable type checking for the raw data from the server, since raw data is missing
the methods. This is okay since any type "checking" here is an illusion anyway.

So CreateObjectEvent now carries data of type "any". It only becomes a BoardObject when that event gets processed
in the frontend.

But this also means that createObject() has no type safety since it constructs an event -> change that, have it take
and object and extract properties from it.
