If reconfiguration of an object invalidates wires, e.g. configure an N-bit inverter to an (N-1)-bit inverter,
then these wires must be removed immediately. It is not enough to check at some crucial point whether the wires' nodes
still exist, because then the user might configure the chip back and the wires re-appear. While this sounds harmless,
it means that now the board's behaviour depends on where these "crucial points" are placed, and might easily
de-synchronize between the server/client and another client.

The above, by itself, only means that wire removal must be well-defined. However, we don't want wires to re-appear at
some later time unexpectedly. So the easiest solution is to define that wires must be removed immediately when one
of their nodes is removed.
